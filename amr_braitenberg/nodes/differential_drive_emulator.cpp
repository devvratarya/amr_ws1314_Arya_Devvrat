  //==================== YOUR CODE HERE ====================
  // Instructions: compute linear and angular components and
  //               fill in the twist message.
  //
  //As you have already learned, our target robotic platform is omni-directional and is controlled by
  //sending geometry_msgs/Twist messages to the cmd_vel topic. These messages comprise both lin-
  //ear and angular components of the desired robotâ€™s velocity. In the Braitenberg vehicles, however,
  //differential-drive control is assumed.
  //Therefore your first task is to implement the
  //differential_drive_emulator node. It will listen to the cmd_vel_diff topic, where messages of
  //the type mr_msgs/WheelSpeeds will be published. These messages convey the speeds of two wheels.
  //Upon reception of such a message the node should calculate and publish a velocity command that
  //will make the robot move as a differential- drive platform would have moved if its wheels were
  //spinning with the given speeds.

        //the value we get is angular velocity of the wheels. So we need to multiply it by radius as V = rW
        lin_vel = ((msg->speeds[0] + msg->speeds[1])/2)*(wheel_diameter/2);
        angular_vel = ((msg->speeds[1] - msg->speeds[0])/distance_between_wheels)*(wheel_diameter/2);
        
        twist.linear.x = lin_vel;
        twist.angular.z = angular_vel;
