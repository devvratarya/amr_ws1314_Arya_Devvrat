* Please start commenting your code. A good way to start is http://www-scf.usc.edu/~peterchd/doxygen/ or any other article or tutorial on commenting

* Basic bugs behaviour looks fine!

* You do not check whether the wall is between you and the goal

* Your walfollower does not seem to correctly check whether you are closer to the goal when leaving from a closer point. 

* Your check for unreachable goals never prints out the message, because your two conditions are contradictory

* Line 133 contains an unnecessary check because the method is only called in wallfollowing mode (self.follow_wall_check == 1)
